<a name="id2660914" id="id2660914"><!--id2660914--></a>Module overview</h1><p>In this module you will be introduced to word-processing, structure and conventions used in this guide.</p><h1>
<a name="id2640011" id="id2640011"><!--id2640011--></a>1 Introduction</h1><p>The ICE (Integrated Content Environment) system provides an easy-to-use editing interface with a web-based application to manage content. Data is stored in XML format to allow for automatic conversion to websites, CD and print.</p><p>ICE has two main components. Firstly, there is a content authoring system with an easy-to-use word-processor based application. Secondly, there is a web-based application designed to tie together all of the systems and resources needed to engage in authoring and to manage content.</p><p>Authors will not be required to edit content using an XML editor. Content can be edited with a familiar word-processing environment, using templates on-campus or off-campus. For further details, visit the USQ website &lt;<a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/dec/staff/ice.htm">http://www.usq.edu.au/dec/staff/ice.htm</a>&gt;.</p><h1>
<a name="id2652630" id="id2652630"><!--id2652630--></a>2 Word-processing</h1><p>OpenOffice.org Writer or Microsoft Word can be used for word-processing ICE content using a template.</p><p>The OpenOffice.org suite is open source and includes applications for presentations (Impress), spreadsheets (Calc), drawings (Draw), formula editor (Math) and word-processing (Writer). Open source means that the software and its program code are available to the public at no cost.</p><h1>
<a name="id2657713" id="id2657713"><!--id2657713--></a>3 Structured content</h1><p>A structured document contains logical elements ordered consistently. For example, a simple structure could be: introduction, topics, conclusion, list of references. When you create structured documents, it can assist the reader and also assist when reusing information.</p><p class="x">There are many benefits to structured documents including: </p><ul class="lib"><li><p>increased usability of the authoring environment as the structure provides guidance</p></li><li><p>ability to automate rendering to multiple output formats</p></li><li><p>easy re-use of content sections</p></li><li><p>consistent format</p></li><li><p>more efficient authoring as formatting is not setup for each individual document by each individual author</p></li><li><p>content can be machine readable as well as human readable. </p></li></ul><h1>
<a name="id2653403" id="id2653403"><!--id2653403--></a>4 Directory structure and access</h1><p>Setting up each package with a logical consistent directory and content structure enables different authors to locate and maintain content. Access needs to be activated with the repository.</p><div align="left" class="Table52"><table class="Table52 note"><tbody>

<td class="Table52_A1">
<p><a name="Note icon" id="Note icon"></a><img alt="Note icon" class="fr1" src="Pictures/10000000000000B1000000B111167E99.png" width="57" height="57" /></p></td>

<td class="Table52_A1">
<p>We recommend that you use the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) file naming conventions which include: </p><ul class="lib"><li><p>use of alpha, numeric and underscores only (do not use dashes, spaces or other characters e.g. ampisand)</p></li><li><p>maximum of 31 characters for the filename (including the extension)</p></li><li><p>maximum of 8 directory levels</p></li><li><p>path maximum of 207 characters.<br />
</p></li></ul><p>If filenames are too long or inappropriate characters are included, some systems will not read the files. For example, filenames are automatically shortened when a CD to be used on all platforms is burnt which in turn can break hyperlinks.</p></td>

<a name="id2659300" id="id2659300"><!--id2659300--></a>4.1 Source (src) folder</h2><p>The ICE system will ignore content located in a ‘src’ folder when creating the website manifest. </p><h3>
<a name="id2655661" id="id2655661"><!--id2655661--></a>Example use </h3><p>Word drawings are included as images in ICE template files. To ensure easy access for  editing, save a source file of the Word drawings in a relevant ‘src’ folder in the course directory structure.</p><h2>
<a name="id2655825" id="id2655825"><!--id2655825--></a>4.2 Package common folder</h2><p>For study material, a ‘common’ folder is located in the into-material directory to house relevant common files.</p><p>The package ‘common’ folder contains a wide range of files plus an ‘icons’ folder. The files can be copied into your content if relevant. </p><h1>
<a name="id2657637" id="id2657637"><!--id2657637--></a>5 Conventions used in this guide</h1><p>As with many software programs, there is usually more than one way to access a function. For example, you may like to use the menus or keyboard shortcuts. This guide will not explain all possibilities when discussing a function. As you become more familiar with OOo Writer and Microsoft Word, you will find the best way that suits you. </p><p class="P4">This guide has been written using OpenOffice.org Writer 2.0 and <span class="T1">Microsoft Word 2003 </span>running on a Windows<sup>xp</sup> operating system. Most of the instructions have been written for users of a PC with some variations for the Mac. The following conventions are used in this guide.</p><ul class="lib"><li><p>OpenOffice.org may be abbreviated to OOo. For example:</p><p>Become familiar with the OOo suite.</p></li><li><p>OpenOffice.org Writer may be abbreviated to Writer. For example:</p><p>Use Writer for word-processing.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft Word may be abbreviated to Word. For example:</p><p>Use Word for word-processing.</p></li><li><p>Actions requiring the use of menus use the ellipses to separate steps. For example:</p><p>From the Menu, select Insert...Picture...From File.</p><p>The ellipses (...) means that one action follows another. The example given above would translate as: From the Menu, select Insert then select the Picture option then select the From File option.</p></li><li><p>When giving step-by-step instructions, it will usually be assumed that you have a word-processor open. Therefore, the first step will not be to instruct you to open Writer or Word.</p></li><li><p>Keyboard shortcuts are placed inside angle brackets. For example:</p><p>Press the &lt;F1&gt; key on the keyboard.</p><p>&lt;Alt&gt; + &lt;S&gt; + &lt;P&gt; + &lt;P&gt; (Translates as: Press the &lt;Alt&gt; key, press the &lt;S&gt; key, press the &lt;P&gt; key, press the &lt;P&gt; key.)</p></li><li><p>URLs are placed inside angle brackets. For example:</p><p>...visit the USQ website &lt;<a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/dec/staff/ice.htm" target="_blank">http://www.usq.edu.au/dec/staff/ice.htm</a>&gt;.</p></li></ul><h1>
<a name="id2655784" id="id2655784"><!--id2655784--></a>6 Information sources</h1><p>This guide has been prepared as a quick reference only. Some other sources for accessing information on Writer, Word and ICE follow.</p><ol class="lin" style="list-style: decimal;"><li><p>The Help supplied with Writer and Word. From the Menu, select Help or press &lt;F1&gt; on the keyboard. Find information about a specific area by searching or using the contents and index.</p></li><li><p>The OpenOffice.org website &lt;<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">http://www.openoffice.org</a>&gt;.</p></li><li><p>The Microsoft website &lt;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</a>&gt;.</p></li><li><p>Reference books such as <i>OpenOffice.org Writer: the free alternative to Microsoft Word</i> by Jean Hollis Weber.</p></li><li><p>An ICE overview &lt;<a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/dec/staff/ice.htm">http://www.usq.edu.au/dec/staff/ice.htm</a>&gt;.</p></li></ol><p></p></body>
