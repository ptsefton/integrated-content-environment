An understanding on how often floods occur is essential to manage the risk of flood damage and to design flood and drainage works.</p><h1><a id="id4" name="id4"><!--id4--></a>3.1 Basic terms </h1><p>For the purpose of this course, floods are defined as relatively high water levels within constructed and natural waterway systems (including creeks, rivers, estuaries, lakes etc.) caused by rainfall. <b>Floodwater</b> resulting when the flow discharge exceeds the confines of the waterway channel can cause significant flood damage to adjacent property and assets. Insurance companies often define flooding in these terms as part of their insurance policies.  </p><h1><a id="id5" name="id5"><!--id5--></a>3.2 Design Flood</h1><h2><a id="id6" name="id6"><!--id6--></a>3.2.1 Definition of a Design Flood</h2><p>A Design Flood is an observed or synthetic (a devised or <span class="spCh spChx2018">&#x2018;</span>made-up<span class="spCh spChx2019">&#x2019;</span> event) flood that is assigned a certain frequency and is used for planning or design. Inundation maps showing the extent of flooding associated with events of various magnitudes are often prepared by local authorities to identify land areas that are floodprone. The limit of flooding associated with a Design Flood can be used to define a land corridor adjacent to a creek or river where the building of houses should be restricted. </p><p>The peak discharge associated with a Design Flood is also used to design flood control works such as floodways and diversion channels, as well as major hydraulic structures including dam spillways and bridge crossings.</p><h2><a id="id7" name="id7"><!--id7--></a>3.2.2 AEP and ARI of a Design Flood</h2><p>A Design Flood is defined by how often (or the number of occurrences) the flood is expected to occur within a certain period of time. A large flood will occur less often than a small flood. The frequency of a Design Flood can be defined in terms of:</p><ul class="lib"><li><p>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) which is the probability or likelihood of  a flood occurring in any one year that is <b>at least</b> the size of the Design Flood</p></li><li><p>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) which is a statistical estimate of the average period of time (in years) between the occurrences of a Design Flood or larger.</p></li></ul><p>A Design Flood that is commonly selected for planning and design is the 100-year ARI flood (or commonly abbreviated to Q100 flood) expected to occur on average once every 100 years. This doesn<span class="spCh spChx2019">&#x2019;</span>t mean that a 100-year ARI flood will happen at regular intervals of every100 years. It is possible to have more than one 100-year ARI flood within a 100-year period, as illustrated by figure 3.1. Ten floods equal or larger than the Q100 are likely to occur during the 1000 year timespan. The recurrence interval between floods will vary, but the average of the recurrence intervals (mean of RI<sub>1</sub>, RI<sub>2</sub>, <span class="spCh spChx2026">&#x2026;</span>RI<sub>9</sub>) is expected to be 100 years.</p><p><a name="graphics1"><!-- --></a><img alt="graphics1" class="fr1" height="190" src="module03_files/2edd3df1_552x190.jpg" style="border:0px; vertical-align: top" width="552"/></p><p class="figure-caption-below"><b>Figure </b><b>3.1</b><b>:</b> Hypothetical series of large flood events over a 1000 year timespan. Only floods larger than Q100 are plotted for clarity</p><p>In the example shown in figure 3.1, maximum instantaneous discharge is used to quantify the size or magnitude of the Design Flood.  Maximum flood level or another flood property such as the duration of flooding can be sometimes used to quantify the Design Flood.</p><p>An alternative way to express the frequency of a Design Flood is the Annual Exceedence Probability (AEP), or probability that the Design Flood will be equalled or exceeded in any one year. A Q<sub>100</sub> or 100-year ARI flood has an AEP of 1 in 100, or 0.01. In other words, the AEP is the reciprocal of the ARI:</p><p>AEP = <a name="Object1"><!-- --></a><img alt="Object1" class="fr3" height="39" src="module03_files/316471f5_32x39bw.png" style="border:0px; vertical-align: baseline; margin-bottom: -12.0px;" width="32"/></p><p>The AEP is conventionally expressed as a percentage, e.g. 1% AEP or as a likelihood e.g. 1 in 100 AEP.</p><h2><a id="id8" name="id8"><!--id8--></a>3.2.3 AEP and risk of failure</h2><p>As AEP is a probability, it can be applied to provide answers to problems often encountered in evaluating the risk of flooding. From general probability theory, it can be demonstrated that:</p><p>F = 1 <span class="spCh spChx2013">&#x2013;</span> (1 <span class="spCh spChx2013">&#x2013;</span> P)<sup> N</sup></p><p>Where F is the probability that at least one flood occurring in N years has an AEP of P. In practice, F is often referred to as the <b>risk of failure</b> or<b> flood risk</b>.</p><p>Some practical examples involving risk of failure are described below.</p><p/><div class="Table14" style="width: 100%; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align:left;"><table class="Table14 example" style="border-spacing: 0;empty-cells: show; width:14.601cm; border-collapse: collapse; "><colgroup><col style="width:2.002cm;"/><col style="width:12.599cm;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="Table14_A1" style="vertical-align: top;  border:none;  padding-bottom:0.3cm;  padding-left:1.0px;  padding-right:1.0px;  padding-top:1.0px; "><p><a name="graphics9"><!-- --></a><img alt="graphics9" class="fr2" height="57" src="module03_files/m7bdd6fe0_57x57.jpg" style="border:0px; vertical-align: top" width="57"/></p></td><td class="Table14_A1" style="vertical-align: top;  border:none;  padding-bottom:0.3cm;  padding-left:1.0px;  padding-right:1.0px;  padding-top:1.0px; "><h6><a id="id9" name="id9"><!--id9--></a>Worked example <span class="T3">3.1</span><span class="T3"> <span class="spCh spChx2013">&#x2013;</span> assessing the risk of failure</span></h6><p class="P8">Example 1</p><p>A house is for sale in a suburb that is located next to a large river. From Council flood maps of the area, the available information suggests that the floor level of the house is the same elevation as the Q100 flood level. A buyer is interested in purchasing the house as a long-term investment and is interested in determining the risk of flooding over the next 20 years. </p><p>From the above statement, we know that as it is the Q100 flood, P=1/100 = 0.01 and also N=20 years. Thus:</p><p>Risk of failure F = 1-(1-0.01)<sup>20</sup> = 0.18</p><p>The risk equates to approximately a 1 in 5 chance that the house will be flooded at least once during the next 20 years. The potential buyer regards this risk as too high as he is unable to obtain flood damage insurance for this property and, in his opinion, flooding of the house will lead to costly repairs and cleanup.</p><p>This example highlights the situation that even though the house seems to have a high immunity against flooding, there is a likelihood of flooding if a sufficient length of time is considered.  </p></td></tr><tr><td class="Table14_A1" style="vertical-align: top;  border:none;  padding-bottom:0.3cm;  padding-left:1.0px;  padding-right:1.0px;  padding-top:1.0px; "><p/></td><td class="Table14_A1" style="vertical-align: top;  border:none;  padding-bottom:0.3cm;  padding-left:1.0px;  padding-right:1.0px;  padding-top:1.0px; "><p class="P8">Example 2</p><p>A dam is to be constructed within a river. A temporary diversion channel is planned to divert river flows around the construction site so the foundations can be built. The diversion channel will be costly to install, but if a flood occurs in the river and it is not diverted then extensive damage to the foundations is expected. Foundation construction is scheduled to be completed within a 2-year timeframe. A cost analysis has been completed and it is decided that an acceptable level of flood risk for the project is 1 in 10 (or 10%).  To what Design Flood should the diversion channel be able to handle?</p><p>From the above statement, we know that F=0.1 and N=2. Thus:</p><p>0.1 = 1- (1-P)<sup>2 </sup> or P = 1-(1-0.1)<sup>0.5</sup> = 0.052</p><p>The AEP of the Design Flood is 5% (rounded down to the nearest percent), which is equivalent to an ARI = 1/0.05 = 20 years.

Ideally, selection of the Design Flood would maximise the net benefit, i.e. the difference between the benefit (expressed as a dollar value) and the cost of implementing the design. The benefit would include a reduction in flood damage and less social and economic disruption that may also be caused by flooding. It is often difficult to assign a monetary value to these benefits. </p><p>A higher Design Flood would typically lead to a higher cost to implement the design. As would be the case for most engineering projects, further increases in the size of the Design Flood would escalate the cost but the increment in benefit may be small (in other words, the <span class="spCh spChx2018">&#x2018;</span>law of diminishing return<span class="spCh spChx2019">&#x2019;</span> would arise).  So, the selection of an appropriate Design Flood is often an uncertain process.</p><p>Due to this uncertainty, a generic approach is often adopted where the Design Flood is chosen based on the type of infrastructure.

The Annual Series is the most common method to select floods for FFA and is preferred for design floods greater than 10-year ARI. For floods smaller than 10-year ARI, the Partial Series is generally preferred as it has a greater representation of recorded events in this range.  The Annual Series may omit many smaller floods that will be of interest as only one flood for each year (the highest) is selected for the Annual Series.  </p><p>In FFA, it is preferred to have at least 10 to 15 years of streamflow records as a minimum set of data for analysis. </p><p>It is assumed in FFA that the future occurrence of floods will follow the same frequency behaviour as the floods recorded at the streamgauge. In other words, information on past floods is used to predict future floods. Thus, it is inappropriate to use FFA if it is intended to predict flood frequencies that may arise from physical changes in the catchment, such as urban development, and/or climate change. In statistical terms, FFA requires data that is <b>stationary</b>, in which the mean and variance of the discharge data do not change with time. </p><p>It is also important that only <b>independent</b> flood peaks are included in the flood frequency analysis. This means that a flood discharge should not be included in the series if it is part of a flood event that already has a selected discharge. Generally this is not a problem for the Annual Series, as only one peak discharge (the highest) is chosen per year. </p><p>The use of a <b>water year </b>instead of a calendar year further increases the likelihood of obtaining independent flood peaks.  In Queensland, and other locations where summer rainfall dominates and winters are drier, the water year starts in October. As shown in figure&#xA0;3.4, this reduces a significant flood event being split between two years.</p><p><a name="graphics4"><!-- --></a><img alt="graphics4" class="fr1" height="190" src="module03_files/m416710f6_552x190.jpg" style="border:0px; vertical-align: top" width="552"/></p><p class="figure-caption-below"><b>Figure </b><b>3.4</b><b>:</b> Discharge time series showing the difference between a calendar year and a water year</p><p>Flood data used in FFA is also required to be <b>homogeneous</b>, or share the same basic types of underlying causes or factors.

This range is called the <b>confidence interval</b>. Using figure 3.5 as an example, we should be 90% confident (=95%-5%) that the true Design Flood discharge will fall within the confidence interval shown.  If the FFA is based on a short Annual Series, then the confidence interval will be large and hence we should be more uncertain about the accuracy of the Design Flood estimate.

As a result, this AEP estimate is called the <b>plotting position</b>. To determine the plotting position, data in the Annual Series is sorted or <b>ranked</b> from the largest discharge to the smallest discharge. The largest flood on record is the rank 1 event and has the lowest AEP.

A commonly used probability distribution is the Normal distribution; this has a classic bell-shaped curve as shown by the example provided in figure 3.6 [A]. This is a plot of the probability of occurrence of a discharge Q, or Pr(Q), against the discharge Q. The Pr(Q) falls with a range between zero and one. </p><p/><div class="Table22" style="width: 100%; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align:left;"><table class="Table22 note" style="border-spacing: 0;empty-cells: show; width:14.601cm; border-collapse: collapse; "><colgroup><col style="width:2.002cm;"/><col style="width:12.599cm;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="Table22_A1" style="vertical-align: top;  border:none;  padding:1.0px; "><p><a name="graphics17"><!-- --></a><img alt="graphics17" class="fr2" height="57" src="module03_files/1e014184_57x57.jpg" style="border:0px; vertical-align: top" width="57"/></p></td><td class="Table22_A1" style="vertical-align: top;  border:none;  padding:1.0px; "><h6><a id="id20" name="id20"><!--id20--></a>Note </h6><p>The term Normal is just a label for the probability distribution of that name.

In other words, the distribution is symmetric around the mean. Two statistical parameters are used to define the Normal distribution; the mean and standard deviation.</p><p>The problem in hydrology is that it is rare that discharge data conforms to a classic Normal distribution. Sometimes, a better fit with a Normal distribution may occur if logs (log to the base 10) are taken of the discharge data. This can result in a good fit with the log-Normal distribution as shown in rigure 3.6 [B]. As data has been <span class="spCh spChx2018">&#x2018;</span>transformed<span class="spCh spChx2019">&#x2019;</span> from Q to log Q, this process is termed <b>log transformation</b>.</p><p>Even after log transformation, the log Q values may not always plot symmetric around the mean as would be the case for a true log-Normal distribution. The peak probability of occurrence Pr (log Q) may be below the mean log Q as indicated by figure 3.7 [A]. This is referred to as <b>positive skew</b>. Most Australian streamflow data based on the Annual Series are in fact positively skewed. If the peak probability of occurrence Pr (log Q) plots above the mean then it has a <b>negative skew</b> (figure 3.7 [B]).

Large historical floods provide valuable information and should be incorporated into the FFA if possible. AR&amp;R provides guidance on how this is done. Another possible complication is the presence of <b>outliers</b> which are individual flood events that plot substantially away from the trend of the other discharges within the Annual Series. These outliers may be present in the data simply as a result of an error or may be the associated with an extreme rainfall event. A method to detect outliers is also provided in AR&amp;R.</p><p>The QY estimates are plotted on the flood frequency graph as shown on the Styx River example in figure 3.5.

The Q<sub>Y</sub> values are estimates only as they are based on a limited sample size governed by the number of years of available record. We would be more confident in the Q<sub>Y</sub> estimates if they were determined from a long streamflow record (more than 50 years) than if a shorter record is available.

(The Negative Exponential has a skew G=2, so G doesn<span class="spCh spChx2019">&#x2019;</span>t need to be computed as done in the LP3 fit to the Annual Series). </p><p>The general practice is to fit a simple regression line to the log ARI discharges.  This can be easily done in EXCEL by using the <span class="spCh spChx2018">&#x2018;</span>Add a trend line<span class="spCh spChx2019">&#x2019;</span> function.  The fitted probability distribution has the basic form given below<span class="spCh spChx2013">&#x2013;</span> the probability of a flood discharge QY having an ARI of Y years is such that:</p><p>Q<sub>Y</sub> = a&#xA0;log(ARI) + b</p><p>where a and b are regression constants.</p><p>It is possible to calculate confidence limits to the fitted Partial Series distribution using regression theory. A method is described in section 6.6.1 of Ladson (2008), but is not covered by this course.</p><h2><a id="id29" name="id29"><!--id29--></a>3.5.4 Calculating Design Flood discharges from partial Series</h2><p>The Q<sub>Y</sub> estimates from the fitted regression curve can be directly used as Design Floods for various ARIs. As noted previously, it is preferred to express Q<sub>Y</sub> estimates from Partial Series FFA in terms of ARI, but in industry practice the use of AEP and ARI is often interchangeable. </p><p>As indicated schematically by figure 3.10, the ARI estimates based on the Partial Series tend to converge with the Annual Series ARI estimates at approximately 10 year ARI (or 1 in 10 AEP). For ARIs less than 10 year ARI, the Partial Series discharge estimate is larger than the Annual Series estimate. The difference is due to the extra flow information included in the Partial Series.</p><p class="P4"><a name="graphics11"><!-- --></a><img alt="graphics11" class="fr2" height="192" src="module03_files/43691f7b_300x192.jpg" style="border:0px; vertical-align: top" width="300"/></p><p class="figure-caption-below"><b>Figure </b><b>3.10</b><b>:</b> Plot of the Annual Series ARI estimate against the Partial Series ARI estimate</p><h1><a id="id30" name="id30"><!--id30--></a>3.6 Extreme floods</h1><p>As the ARI increases, Design Flood discharges estimated using flood frequency analysis become less accurate. It is recommended that FFA should not be used for Design Floods bigger than 1 in 100 AEP (the absolute limit of extrapolating estimates based on FFA is 1 in 500 AEP).</p><p>As indicated by table 3.1, there are some types of major infrastructure such as dam spillways that are designed to handle extreme floods of up to 1 in 1,000,000 AEP. Estimating the Design Flood discharge associated with events of this magnitude is a specialised task and is not covered by this Course.  Details can be found in AR&amp;R.</p><h1><a id="id31" name="id31"><!--id31--></a>Summary</h1><p>The flood frequency analysis (FFA) is one method to estimate Design Floods of various AEP. Providing that there is an accurate streamflow record of sufficient length, FFA has several advantages over alternative methods:</p><ul class="lib"><li><p>It is a simpler procedure.</p></li><li><p>All factors affecting the flood discharge are inherently incorporated in the resulting Design Floods, as it is based on measured streamflows.</p></li><li><p>The flood of the required AEP is estimated directly, so no knowledge of the relationship between rainfall and runoff probabilities is needed.</p></li><li><p>Confidence limits can be calculated to show the uncertainty of the results.</p></li><li><p>The method doesn<span class="spCh spChx2019">&#x2019;</span>t require rainfall data, so raingauge records or estimation of rainfall losses are not required.</p></li></ul><p>However, there are several features of FFA that should be considered when deciding to use this method to estimate Design Flood discharges, especially for large, low AEP events:</p><ul class="lib"><li><p>FFA is based on an arbitrarily selected probability distribution (LP3 for the Annual Series) as the true form of the flood probability distribution cannot be established from the comparatively short records of Australian stream gauges (generally less than 100 years)</p></li><li><p>Significant uncertainty will exist in estimating Design Floods from a short streamflow record, particularly with the skew that is present.</p></li><li><p>It is very difficult to adjust the data to account for any catchment changes that occurred during the streamflow record, or are expected to occur during the future life of the works under design</p></li><li><p>Considerable extrapolation of the streamgauge rating curves is generally necessary to convert recorded stage to discharge for the largest recorded flood peaks. Failure of recording equipment often happens during large floods, so these key events may be unrecorded.</p></li></ul><p>When there is insufficient streamflow records to undertake a FFA, the engineering hydrologist must estimate the Design Flood discharge from rainfall data. This is described further in modules 5 and 6.</p><h1><a id="id32" name="id32"><!--id32--></a>List of references</h1><p>Ladson, A 2008,<i> Hydrology <span class="spCh spChx2013">&#x2013;</span> an Australian introduction,</i> Oxford University Press.</p><h1><a id="id33" name="id33"><!--id33--></a>Additional resources</h1><p>Tables 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 from AR &amp; R.</p><p class="P6"><a href="../../env/3105/s2/media/resources/table2_2.pdf" onclick="javascript:window.open(&quot;../../env/3105/s2/media/resources/table2_2.pdf&quot;);return false;"><b>Table 2.2</b>:</a> Frequency factors K<sub>Y</sub> for use with Log-Pearson Type III distribution (positive skew coefficients).</p><p><a href="../../env/3105/s2/media/resources/table2_3.pdf" onclick="javascript:window.open(&quot;../../env/3105/s2/media/resources/table2_3.pdf&quot;);return false;"><b>Table 2.3</b></a></p><p class="P8"><a href="../../env/3105/s2/media/resources/table2_4.pdf" onclick="javascript:window.open(&quot;../../env/3105/s2/media/resources/table2_4.pdf&quot;);return false;">Table 2.4</a></p></body></html>
