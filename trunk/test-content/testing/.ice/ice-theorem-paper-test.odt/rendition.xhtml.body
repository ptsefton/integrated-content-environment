This work is focused on theses, as it is well understood that early career researchers are the most likely to lead the charge in new innovations in scholarly publishing and dissemination models.</p><p class="meta-abstract">The authoring tools are built on the <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/"><span class="Internet_20_link">ICE</span></a> content management system, which allows authors to work within a word processing system (as most authors do) with easy-to-use toolbars to structure and format their documents. The ICE system manages both small data files and links to larger data sets. The result is research publication which are available not just as paper-ready PDF files but as fully interactive semantically aware web documents which can be disseminated via repository software such as ePrints, DSpace and Fedora as complete supported web-native <b>and</b> PDF publications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </p><p class="meta-abstract">One the technological side, ICE-TheOREM implemented the Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE) protocol to integrate between a content management system, a thesis management system and multiple repository software packages and looked at ways to describe aggregate objects which include both data and documents, which can be generalized to domains other than chemistry.

The <a href="http://ice.usq.edu.au/">ICE</a> (Integrated Content Environment) extension to that project showed how chemical theses could be authored in a word processing environment, following from proof of concept work presented at the Electronic Theses and Dissertations conference in 2007 [TODO: ref]. We have been able to demonstrate theses that are both 'supported' by data in Neylon's terms  (Neylon 2008)<span class="spCh spChx2060">&#x2060;</span> and are datuments (Murray-Rust &amp; Rzepa 2004)<span class="spCh spChx2060">&#x2060;</span> that is they are hypertext aggregations of document and data, which are both human and machine-readable.</p><p>The centerpiece of the ICE-TheOREM project has been a thesis by Malcolm Tait. The thesis is show here in the ICE system, running in the virtual machine we created for the project:</p><p/><div class="slide"><h1>The Tait thesis</h1><p><a name="graphics1"/><img alt="graphics1" class="fr1" height="299" src="ice-theorem-paper-test_files/33a2f848_484x299.jpg" style="border:0px; vertical-align: top" width="484"/></p></div><p>Each of the documents that make up the thesis is a word processing file.

It uses styles to convey structural information about a document, the author applies styles using a toolbar, and the document can be converted to HTML format or sent to a website (usually a weblog) via the Atom Publishing protocol. In this case, though the author does not have to click any buttons in the word processor to see the thesis in HTML, they look at it through the ICE web application, which runs on their desktop.</p><p>Because the image of a molecule, <code><span style="font-style:normal; "><span class="T6">(1,1-dimethylethyl)[(1R,3r,5S)-6,7-dioxabicyclo[3.2.2]non-8-en-3-yloxy]dimethylsilane</span></span></code> is linked to a Chemical Markup Language file describing it, the ICE application embeds a 3d rendition of the molecule of the page.</p><p/><div class="slide"><h1>Interactive data-aware documents</h1><p><a name="graphics9"/><img alt="graphics9" class="fr3" height="194" src="ice-theorem-paper-test_files/3dd37572_203x194.jpg" style="border:0px; vertical-align: top" width="203"/></p></div><p>The ICE system allows for stand-off annotation of documents in a way that is similar to the <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/commentpress/">ComentPress system</a>.

This could be accomplished by a 'pull' process where the repository watches the ICE system and fetches theses with a certain flag set, such as ready for examination, as described in the competition entry for Open Repositories 2008 <i>Zero Click Ingest</i>, but in ICE-TheOREM we have used a push system, where the candidate uses the SWORD function to send the thesis to a thesis repository. </p><div class="slide"><h1>Initial thesis submission - schematic</h1><p><a name="graphics10"/><img alt="graphics10" class="fr1" height="164" src="ice-theorem-paper-test_files/med0b729_484x164.jpg" style="border:0px; vertical-align: top" width="484"/></p><p/></div><p/><p>One of the major contributions of ICE-TheOREM is a model for granular thesis embargo. Our demonstration image contains one document which is to be embargoed. In this case it is the acknowledgements section which will embargoed, it is more likely that more substantial parts of a thesis will be embargoed for reasons to do with commerical exploitation or privacy of subjects, but we have heard of a case where a PhD graduate was happy for an entire thesis to be made open access apart from the acknowledgements.</p><p/><div class="slide"><h1>Embargo metadata is encoded in a style:</h1><p><a name="graphics4"/><img alt="graphics4" class="fr1" height="87" src="ice-theorem-paper-test_files/66552810_484x87.jpg" style="border:0px; vertical-align: top" width="484"/></p><p>And ICE can extract the metadata:</p>
