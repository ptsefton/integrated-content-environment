S'<p>A hyperlink (link) is a specific area that, when activated (usually by a mouse click) will take you to information within the same file or to other files. Some other functions a hyperlink may perform are sending email or submitting forms. A hyperlink within text is often coloured and underlined so it is prominent. Graphics may also have a hyperlink applied though it is not always obvious. If a linked graphic has a border it will usually be blue for recognition. </p>'
